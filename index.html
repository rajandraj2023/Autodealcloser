<br>At the entrance door or at a reception, you can show a QR code for the dealership so buyers get busy and can ask for a sales person if they want. Buyers see all your inventory too.
<br>We also give you a QR code (vinyl front adhesvie sticker) for each of your car. Buyers scan it from the parking lot and can finalize the price online and get the voucher at the end of successful negotiations which they can bring in for remaining formalities.
Buyers have to check in first so you will know who came in, at what time and what car they showed interest for.</p>
